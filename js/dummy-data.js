   dummy-data.js
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Static reference/configuration data for the MSME Origination Toolkit
   prototype: MSME classification slabs, bank ticket-size segments, the
   RBI Repo Rate benchmark + bank-spread components, document checklists,
   pipeline stages, loan product mapping and sidebar navigation.

   MIGRATION NOTE (per the frontend -> backend roadmap): everything in
   this file is exactly the kind of configuration that should eventually
   be served from an admin-managed database/API instead of being
   hardcoded here. When wiring up the backend, replace these constants
   with fetch() calls to your API and keep the rest of the app unchanged.
